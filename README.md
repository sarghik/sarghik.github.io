3D PRINTED DRONE

Objective: 

The goal of this project is to design and build a fully functional, lightweight quadcopter using 3D printing and CAD modeling. At the same time, this project serves as a platform to enhance my skills in SolidWorks, 3D printing, and fabrication. This project reflects my interest in vertical flight technology, which I hope to further develop in the future.




Design Process:

- Researched drone models and compared x-frames to h-frames to select the optimal structure for a lightweight, 3D-printed quadcopter.
- Utilized SolidWorks to design and model a custom drone X-frame, applying engineering principles to ensure durability and performance.
- Gained hands-on experience in 3D printing, refining design for efficient fabrication and assembly.
- Currently continuing to 3D print designs and preparing to mount the electronics.
- I chose the RCinPOWER GTS-V2 1202.5 11500Kv Micro Motor for its optimal power to weight ratio which provide the necessary thrust and agility for a lightweight drone. At only 4.3 grams, it keeps the overall frame light, improving agility.
- The frame of the drone is approximately 6 inches x 6 inches.


Technical Challenges and Solutions:
- Considering that I am just beginning the building aspect of the project, most of the obstacles I encountered so far relate to SolidWorks and simply determining how to initiate the project. At first, I was unsure of how to begin this entire project but I focused on one step at a time and gradually made progress. I began with researching different drones, the parts within them, and the importance of quality to help me in my purchasing decisions. Eventually I drew designs of what I wanted my drone to look like and went to SolidWorks from there. In SolidWorks, I learned how to use new features such as the circular sketch pattern which helped create copies of and mirrored sketch entities.


Skills:
- SolidWorks
- 3D Printing
- Iterative Design

- For this project, I purchased parts such as a flight controller, motors, propellers, and a battery to power everything. Looking at the design aspect, I created a simple prototype of my drone. I am currently working on printing a functional prototype and working to enhancing the CAD with specific measurements for the holes needed to mount the electronics properly.
